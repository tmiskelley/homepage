            <h2>The ultimate strategy game</h2>
            <p>
                Chess is by far one of the most complex, and simultaneously
                balanced two player board game that exists today. Because of
                it's complexity, it would be impossible for me to go over every
                aspect of the game here, but the game is essentially composed of
                three main sections:

            <ul id="info" class="d-flex flex-column gap-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Opening</strong>
                    <p>
                        The initial phase of the game where players develop their pieces,
                        fight for control of the center of the board, and prepare for the middlegame.
                        Establishing pawn structures, ensuring king safety, and coordinating your
                        pieces are essential in determining the winner at the end of the game.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Middle game</strong>
                    <p>
                        The central and strategic phase of the game, where players execute their
                        plans and tactics. Both sides aim to improve their positions, attack the
                        opponent's king, and create weaknesses in the opponent's camp.
                        Middlegame positions can be complex, requiring careful calculation
                        and strategic thinking.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>End game</strong>
                    <p>
                        As the game progresses, pieces are often exchanged, leading to a
                        simplified position known as the endgame. In this stage, players focus on
                        converting their advantages, such as material superiority or a better
                        pawn structure, into a winning position. Endgames demand precise
                        calculation and a good understanding of pawn and king dynamics.
